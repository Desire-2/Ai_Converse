## Deploy

## Running Locally

**1. Clone Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui.git
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm i
```

**3. Provide OpenAI API Key**

Create a .env.local file in the root of the repo with your OpenAI API Key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

> You can set `OPENAI_API_HOST` where access to the official OpenAI host is restricted or unavailable, allowing users to configure an alternative host for their specific needs.

> Additionally, if you have multiple OpenAI Organizations, you can set `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` to specify one.

**4. Run App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**5. Use It**

You should be able to start chatting.



If you do not provide an OpenAI API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, users will have to provide their own key.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
